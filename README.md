If we are going to deploy this on production, what do you think is the next
improvement that you will prioritize next? This can be a feature, a tech debt, or
an architectural design.

-The month rate and daily rate should be saved per employee on the database and not "hard-coded"
-Tax deduction can also be put to settings/database in case this will be changed in the future.
-Can be restructured into microservices architecture and this will be easier to test and doesn't need to use Mock.
